;Comment2 if game is paused/unpaused u can start at 2nd minute for stck and power runes with f7  

;if game is paused/unpaused u can start bounty rune reminder with f8 on every 5th Minute 

 
THING TO DO
ADD RS TIMER   
When Roshan is slain, he respawns after a random time between 8â€“11 minutes. Unlike with other neutral creeps, the respawn cannot be prevented by any means. The players do not get any indicator for when exactly he respawns, but spectators and casters can see a clock at Roshan's spawn point, showing the exact time left for the respawn (not until 5 minutes after Roshan was slain).
